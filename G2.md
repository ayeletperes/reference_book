## Allele appearnce 

The group of IGHV1-2 includes 7 alleles, 7 out of the alleles are functional.

For each allele we counted the number of appearances across the population, any appearance was considered valid.

## Group alignment

Based on the viewd alleles, we calculated the distance between the germline sequences.

## Sequence depth

To examine the potential cutoff we observed the sequence depth for each allele

## 0.5% cutoff 

We set an initial cutoff of $0.5\%$ to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.




With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 4 zygousity states.
