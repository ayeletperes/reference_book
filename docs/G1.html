<p>The group of IGHV1-18 includes 4 alleles, 4 out of the alleles are functional.</p>
<p>For each allele we counted the number of appearances across the population, any appearance was considered valid.</p>
<p><img src="G1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Based on the viewd alleles, we calculated the distance between the germline sequences.</p>
<p><img src="G1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="1728" /></p>
<p>To examine the potential cutoff we observed the sequence depth for each allele</p>
<p><img src="G1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>
<p>With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 3 zygousity states.</p>

<p>From the plots we can that the dominantes alleles <em>01</em> and <em>04</em>. They appear in all states. Alleles <em>01</em> and <em>03</em> are closer to eachother, hence in state 3 for the threshold of <span class="math inline">\(0.5%\)</span> I suspect that the sequences are mis-assigned and should be allele <em>01</em>. Otherwise we should have seen the allele in one of the other stated as well.</p>
<p>Further the relations between <em>01</em> and <em>04</em> tends to heterozygousity with equal usage, thus the appearance of the lowly expressed allele in state 2 are likely erroneous.</p>
<p>From the results we belive that the cutoff for this group should be closer to <span class="math inline">\(20%\)</span>, and for the adjusted states the allele combinations and the relations are stated in the table below.</p>
