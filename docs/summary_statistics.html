</div>


<p>Summary statistics for each of the functional groups declared in the app.</p>
<p>The app includes the P1 and P11 naive datasets and the P4 non-naive dataset.</p>
<p>For P1 and P11 the following filtration criteria were applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional sequence, no stop codons or frame shifts.</li>
<li>Sequences which start from position 1 of the V gene.</li>
<li>Sequences which didn’t have gaps open (-) and didn’t include any N’s</li>
<li>After changing into group annotations, sequences which had more than a single assignment in naive repertoires were remove.</li>
</ul>
<p>The groups were created with similarity of 95% based on complete linkage and functional sequences and up to position 318.</p>
<div id="ighv1-18" class="section level2">
<h2>IGHV1-18</h2>
<p>The group of IGHV1-18 includes 4 alleles, 4 out of the alleles are functional.</p>
<p>For each allele we counted the number of appearances across the population, any appearance was considered valid.</p>
<p><img src="summary_statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Based on the viewd alleles, we calculated the distance between the germline sequences.</p>
<p><img src="summary_statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="1728" /></p>
<p>To examine the potential cutoff we observed the sequence depth for each allele</p>
<p><img src="summary_statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>
<p>With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 3 zygousity states.</p>

<p>From the plots we can that the dominantes alleles <em>01</em> and <em>04</em>. They appear in all states. Alleles <em>01</em> and <em>03</em> are closer to eachother, hence in state 3 for the threshold of <span class="math inline">\(0.5%\)</span> I suspect that the sequences are mis-assigned and should be allele <em>01</em>. Otherwise we should have seen the allele in one of the other stated as well.</p>
<p>Further the relations between <em>01</em> and <em>04</em> tends to heterozygousity with equal usage, thus the appearance of the lowly expressed allele in state 2 are likely erroneous.</p>
<p>From the results we belive that the cutoff for this group should be closer to <span class="math inline">\(20%\)</span>, and for the adjusted states the allele combinations and the relations are stated in the table below.</p>

<h2>IGHV1-2</h2>
<p>The group of IGHV1-2 includes 7 alleles, 7 out of the alleles are functional.</p>
<p>For each allele we counted the number of appearances across the population, any appearance was considered valid.</p>
<p><img src="summary_statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Based on the viewd alleles, we calculated the distance between the germline sequences.</p>

<p>To examine the potential cutoff we observed the sequence depth for each allele</p>
<p><img src="summary_statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>
<p>With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 4 zygousity states.</p>

<p>From the plots we can that the homozygous alleles <em>02</em> and <em>04</em>. However, in an heterozygous state the tradoff between the allele differ by the combinations.</p>
<p>Allele <em>04</em> tend to be less dominante when coupled with another allele, making the observation we see closer to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in state 2 to be incorect and they should be homozygous.</p>
<p>Allele <em>02</em> when coupled with either allele <em>06</em> or <em>07</em> there is an equal allelic usage.</p>
<p>Allele <em>05</em> is lowly expressed in all combinations and state, making him a suspect of mis-assignment. When copuled with allele <em>04</em> its relative use is closer to <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span> but the amount of sequences is quit low.</p>
<p>Allele <em>06</em> seems to have high usage when in combinations with other alleles, hence it is less likely that in states 3 and 4 it will apear in such low usage. In those cases we can speculate of a mis-assignment, which could be allele <em>05</em>, it’s closeset allele.</p>
<p>From the results we belive that the cutoff for this group should be closer to <span class="math inline">\(2%\)</span>, and for the adjusted states the allele combinations and the relations are stated in the table below.</p>
