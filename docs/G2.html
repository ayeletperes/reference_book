<p>The group of IGHV1-2 includes 7 alleles, 7 out of the alleles are functional.</p>
<p>For each allele we counted the number of appearances across the population, any appearance was considered valid.</p>
<p><img src="G2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Based on the viewd alleles, we calculated the distance between the germline sequences.</p>
<p><img src="G2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="1728" /></p>
<p>To examine the potential cutoff we observed the sequence depth for each allele</p>
<p><img src="G2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>
<p>With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 4 zygousity states.</p>

<p>From the plots we can that the homozygous alleles <em>02</em> and <em>04</em>. However, in an heterozygous state the tradoff between the allele differ by the combinations.</p>
<p>Allele <em>04</em> tend to be less dominante when coupled with another allele, making the observation we see closer to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in state 2 to be incorect and they should be homozygous.</p>
<p>Allele <em>02</em> when coupled with either allele <em>06</em> or <em>07</em> there is an equal allelic usage.</p>
<p>Allele <em>05</em> is lowly expressed in all combinations and state, making him a suspect of mis-assignment. When copuled with allele <em>04</em> its relative use is closer to <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span> but the amount of sequences is quit low.</p>
<p>Allele <em>06</em> seems to have high usage when in combinations with other alleles, hence it is less likely that in states 3 and 4 it will apear in such low usage. In those cases we can speculate of a mis-assignment, which could be allele <em>05</em>, it’s closeset allele.</p>
<p>From the results we belive that the cutoff for this group should be closer to <span class="math inline">\(2%\)</span>, and for the adjusted states the allele combinations and the relations are stated in the table below.</p>
