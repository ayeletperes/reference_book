<h2 id="allele-appearnce">Allele appearnce</h2>
<p>The group of IGHV1-2 includes 7 alleles, 7 out of the alleles are functional.</p>
<p>For each allele we counted the number of appearances across the population, any appearance was considered valid.</p>

<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>

<p>From the results we belive that the cutoff for this group should be closer to <span class="math inline">\(2\%\)</span> except allele <strong>05</strong> that should stay at <span class="math inline">\(0.5\%\)</span> , and for the adjusted states the allele combinations and the relations are stated in the table below.</p>
