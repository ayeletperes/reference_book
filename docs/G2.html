<p>To examine the potential cutoff we observed the sequence depth for each allele</p>

<h2 id="cutoff">0.5% cutoff</h2>
<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 4 zygousity states.</p>

<p>From the results we belive that the cutoff for this group should be closer to <span class="math inline">\(2\%\)</span> except allele <strong>05</strong> that should stay at <span class="math inline">\(0.5\%\)</span> , and for the adjusted states the allele combinations and the relations are stated in the table below.</p>
