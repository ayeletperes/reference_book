For P1 and P11 the following filtration criteria were applied: Functional sequence, no stop codons or frame shifts. Sequences which start from position 1 of the V gene. Sequences which didn’t have gaps open (-) and didn’t include any N’s After changing into group annotations, sequences which had more than a single assignment in naive repertoires were remove. The groups were created with similarity of 95% based on complete linkage and functional sequences and up to position 318.
