For P1 and P11 the following filtration criteria were applied: Functional sequence, no stop codons or frame shifts. Sequences which start from position 1 of the V gene. Sequences which didn’t have gaps open (-) and didn’t include any N’s After changing into group annotations, sequences which had more than a single assignment in naive repertoires were remove. The groups were created with similarity of 95% based on complete linkage and functional sequences and up to position 318. 1.2 Group devision by 95% similarity 1.3 Projects sequence depth "],["01-G1.html", "2 IGHV1-18 - G1 2.1 Allele appearnce 2.2 Group alignment 2.3 Sequence depth 2.4 0.5% cutoff 2.5 Observations 2.6 Conclusions", " 2 IGHV1-18 - G1 2.1 Allele appearnce The group of IGHV1-18 includes 4 alleles, 4 out of the alleles are functional.
