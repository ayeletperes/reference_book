-   From the plots we can see that the homozygous alleles are **02** and **04**. However, in a heterozygous state the tradeoff between the allele differs by the combinations.

-   Allele **04** tend to be less dominant when paired with another allele, making the observation we see closer to *1* in state 2 to be incorrect and they should be homozygous.

```{=html}

```
-   Allele **02** when coupled with either allele **06** or **07** there is an equal allelic usage.

```{=html}

```
-   Allele **05** is lowly expressed in all combinations and state, making it a suspect of mis-assignment. When coupled with allele **04** its relative use is closer to *0.1* but the number of sequences is quite low.

```{=html}

```
-   Allele **06** seems to have high usage when in combinations with other alleles, hence it is less likely that in states 3 and 4 it will appear in such low usage. In those cases, we can speculate of a mis-assignment, which could be allele **05**, its closest allele.
